# ocaml-bencode-parser

An example of how to encode a beautiful idea —or rather formalism— in a robust way.

To look at the source code, please head over to `./lib/bencode.ml` and `./bin/bencode_demo` shows an example of how to use the bencode library.

To run:

```
dune build
dune exec bencode
```
